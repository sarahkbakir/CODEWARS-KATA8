// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    let arr1Sum = 0;
    let arr2Sum = 0;
    
    for(let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
      arr1Sum += arr1[i];
    }
      for(let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
      arr2Sum += arr2[i];
    }
    
    return arr1Sum + arr2Sum;
  }
